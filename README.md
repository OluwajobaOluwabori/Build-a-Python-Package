# Build-a-Python-Package

This is my solution to one of the exercises in AWS Machine Learning - Udacity 

This package contains code to analyze gaussian distribution. The package can be used to read in a dataset, calculate the mean and standard deviation.

It can also be used plot a histogram of the dataset and probability density function of a gaussian distribution.
